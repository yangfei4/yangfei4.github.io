## Introduction
Welcome to my homepage! I am master student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-champaign. My advisor is [Timothy Bretl](http://bretl.csl.illinois.edu/people). I'm interested in **machine learning and computer vision** algorithms.

## Research Project
### Pose estimation for small-scale type-C components
* Focus: Instance segmentation and pose estimation for small, reflective, and symmetric USB components.
* Trained Mask R-CNN using cutomized and augmented synthetic datasets and self-collected real datasets.
* Developing a data labeling tool for real image based on Opencv and Pyrender with 25fps refresh rate.
