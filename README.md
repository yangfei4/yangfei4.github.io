## Research Project
### Pose estimation for small-scale type-C components [Link](https://github.com/yangfei4/Sim2real)
* Focus: Instance segmentation and pose estimation for small, reflective, and symmetric USB components.
* Trained Mask R-CNN using cutomized and augmented synthetic datasets and self-collected real datasets.
* Developing a data labeling tool for real image based on Opencv and Pyrender with 25fps refresh rate.
