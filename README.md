## Research Project
### Pose estimation for small-scale type-C components [Link](https://github.com/yangfei4/Sim2real)
* Focus: Instance segmentation and pose estimation for small, reflective, and symmetric USB components.
* Trained Mask R-CNN using cutomized and augmented synthetic datasets and self-collected real datasets.
* Developing a data labeling tool for real image based on Opencv and Pyrender with 25fps refresh rate.

## Engineering Projecs
### Robotics Engineer Intern
* Built a deicing robot prototype for transmission lines relying on STM32-based embedded system.
* Utilized low-amplitude and high-frequency vibration to destroy the ice cover on the cable surface.
* This innovative deicing project is continuously carried on by the company.

### Robotics projects
* Assembly UR3 robot simulation, focusing on kinematics, detection and motion planning. [Link](https://github.com/yangfei4/Sampling_motion_planning)
* Designed, manufactured, and assembled a cross-beam FDM 3D-printer. The printer control board is Makerbase MKS Robin2. Its build volume is 18cm*15cm*19cm, and the maximum printing error is 0.2 mm.
* Designed, manufactured, and assembled a household intelligent seal-cutting machine. Patent Application number is CN111993826A.
